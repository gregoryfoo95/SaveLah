# **_SaveLah!_**

# **Project Background**
SaveLah! is a project that manifested out of my current life situation: having to juggle between my HDB BTO Renovation and my Wedding Banquet in 2023 as a young adult in Singapore. It serves as a budget management app for different categories of expenditure I would have to fork out in the coming months. 
# **Project Description**
This project is a traditional Create-Read-Update-Delete (CRUD) Web-App that responds to client requests with a new HTML page. It serves to exercise the skills that were taught from General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive Course on general full-stack development utilising the MEN stack (MongoDB, Express and NodeJS).
